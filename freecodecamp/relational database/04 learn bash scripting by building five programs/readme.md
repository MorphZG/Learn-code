# Learn bash scripting by building five programs

Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks, and much more. In this 220-lesson course, you will learn more terminal commands and how to use them within Bash scripts by creating five small programs.

## My notes

I have started by creating a simple shell script `questionnaire.sh`. I was first introduced with `echo` command, adding execute permission to file with `chmod +x <filename>`, locating bash shell with `which bash` and adding shebang to the top of my script following the location of bash interpreter. Than we continued with some basics like variables, reading from input and so on.
